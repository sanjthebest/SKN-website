            <h1>Scarlet Knight News : A Beacon of Voice and Purpose at Rutgers University</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to Scarlet Knight News (SKN), Rutgers University's newest TV broadcasting and streaming news 
                network! We are here to create a community where everyone’s voice matters, and we are all about 
                giving a platform to those who might not usually get heard. Our mission? To give voices to the voiceless, 
                comfort the afflicted, and, yes, sometimes afflict the comfortable.
            </p>

            <p>
                SKN was founded in 2023 by Dio Gonzalez, whose passion for accessible TV broadcasting sparked the idea to 
                bring this platform to Rutgers. Dio saw the potential for a space where students could learn, create, and 
                share stories in a way that is both impactful and inclusive. His vision has become the foundation of SKN, 
                driving us to innovate and expand what is possible in student-led journalism. At SKN, we are shaking things up 
                by running our broadcasts on YouTube instead of traditional airwaves or newspapers. We believe that 
                journalism should not be confined to the pros—everyone has a story to tell, and we are here to help you 
                tell it. Whether you are filming with your phone or editing on the go, we are showing that journalism 
                can be accessible, collaborative, and, above all, impactful. But we are not just about creating content; 
                we are also about building skills. SKN offers Rutgers students hands-on experience in videography, 
                storytelling, and the ins and outs of the journalism field. Plus, we are gearing up to compete in state 
                and national competitions for Broadcast Journalism, with our sights set on making a name for Rutgers on a 
                larger stage.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we grow, we are excited to explore new ways of capturing stories, whether through video, podcasts, 
                or other media. No matter what, our focus will always be on reporting what is important and shining a 
                light on the stories that deserve attention. So, if you are passionate about making a difference and want 
                to be part of a community that values every voice, SKN is the place for you. Join us in creating content 
                that matters and making a real impact on the Rutgers community!
